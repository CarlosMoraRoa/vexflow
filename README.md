# VexFlow MusicXML plugin

This is a fork of [@ringw's spectacular fork of VexFlow](https://github.com/ringw/vexflow/tree/musicxml) that adds support for loading MusicXML documents. That effort, which quite successful, is not actively synced with the [upstream repository](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow), so it does not enjoy the benefits of VexFlow's active development.

Given the difficult of maintaining forks for long periods, this project simply organizes @ringw's contribution as a plugin to the core VexFlow project. I've removed everything except the [files that are specific to the fork](https://github.com/ringw/vexflow/compare/0xfe:master...musicxml).

## Installation

First, install Vexflow itself:

	git clone https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow

(If you prefer, you can `npm install vexflow` or `bower install vexflow` -- doesn't matter so long as you know where to find it.)
